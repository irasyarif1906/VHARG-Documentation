# Download ERA5 data to the Komodo cluster @ NTU/ASE :volcano: :tiger2:

  - [Intro](#intro)
  - [Download wind data](#download-wind-data)

## Intro
Try to download wind data (appropriately named) to ```/home/volcano/Wind/``` so that others have access if needed. 
List loaded modules with ```module list```. Required modules are:

```
module add python/3.5.3
```

You will also need to make an account and then download your API key from CDS:
https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to

The API key should be placed in your account here: ```~/.cdsapirc```

## Download wind data
Go to: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=form and choose what wind data you want.
Typically, you need 'geopotential', 'U-component of wind', and 'V-component of wind' to get wind speed and direction with height for a volcano.
You can choose the area to cover, years and hourly or less temporal resolution.

Click 'NetCDF' as the format and then 'Show API request'

Copy and paste this request into a new file on the cluster that describes what you're downloading, e.g.:

```vi ERA5_Hrly_2010-2019_FujiDownload.py```

Press ```Esc```, then ```:wq``` to save the file

To run it, ssh to a node (do not run on the main master node!): ```qsub -I```

navigate to where you were: ```cd /home/volcano/WindDownload``` 

and to run, type (for the example above): ```python3 ERA5_Hrly_2010-2019_FujiDownload.py```

|:warning: The size limit is pretty small... |

| You will see a warning on the website if you are trying to download too many fields. If you see this, you'll need to separate your request into multiple requests, typically by year or area, or hPa. They can be concatenated together later, if needed.|
