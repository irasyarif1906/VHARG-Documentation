# Creating a GIS Overlay with Georeferenced Photos

If you have field photos taken with a camera that has a GPS, you can easily view they all in their map locations in Google Earth etc.

## Steps to create KML

1. Put all the photos you want to see on the map in the same folder
2. Go to the website https://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2015/11/importing-geotagged-photos-into-google-earth.html
3. Click the button to upload files and select all of the photos you want
4. Click the "Create KML File" button. Done!
5. Put the KML file in the same folder as the photos.
6. Open the KML file in Google Earth (or other compatible GIS program)

This KML file does not contain the actual photos, so if you do not put it in the folder with the photos (e.g. if you send it to someone else), then the locations will still show up as points in the GIS program, but you will only see the file names, not the photos. But the upside is a very small file size.

If you want the photos included in the file...

## Steps to create KMZ

1. Open the KML file created in the previous steps in Google Earth
2. Right click the KML file name under "Temporary Places" and click "Save place as..."
3. Save the file as a .kmz

Now if you move or send the KMZ file apart from the original photos, it will still have all the photos contained.
