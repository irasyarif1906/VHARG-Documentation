# Install maps on a Garmin GPS

This procedure illustrates how to install OpenStreetMap basemaps on a Garmin GPS device.

## Required software
The required software are:

- [Garmin BaseCamp](https://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=4435)
- [Garmin MapInstall](https://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=3291)
- [Garmin MapManager](https://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=5267)

You might have to Google them to download them!

## Choose a map
1. Visit [this page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_Map_On_Garmin/Download) for an overview of the providers of OpenStreetMap data (OSM) for Garmin GPS. The prefered website is [garmin.openstreetmap.nl](http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl).
2. There are 3 main options of file formats:
   - ``.exe`` is the format of map installer for Windows
   - ``.gmapi`` is the format of map installer for Mac
   - ``gmapsupp.img`` is the raw data
3. If the file is either ``.exe`` or ``.gmapi``, the install should be easy - either double-click it or open with MapInstall. If the files is a ``gmapsupp.img``, then it is not possible to open it in BaseCamp. It is still possible to upload it on your GPS by replacing the ``gmapsupp.img`` file contained on your device by the new one. By doing so, you are essentially replacing the system basemap by a custom one, so **backing it up is a good idea**.
